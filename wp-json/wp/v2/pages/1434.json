General Terms and Conditions of a Client are expressly rejected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.3. Tradecast does not accept any general (written) references to general terms and conditions of a Client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions are declared null or void, the remaining provisions in these General Terms and Conditions will remain in force regardless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.5. Tradecast retains the right to change the General Terms and Conditions at any time. Changes also apply to agreements already in force.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.6.

Realisation of the agreement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.1. Bids are made in writing (and\/or by email) and are completely non-binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.2.

In that event, Tradecast is legally entitled to charge the customary price for such additional work, in addition to the price agreed upon for the Service. In the event that changes result in less work, the agreed upon price will remain in force.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.3. For the execution of the service, Tradecast is (partially) dependent on the data and information provided by the Client. Tradecast cannot perform the Service in the event that the provision of data and information does not and\/or not timely take place. Tradecast does not commit any breach towards the Client in the event that data and\/or information which is provided by the Client too late and\/or incorrectly results in shortcomings in the performance of the Service.

The Client is not entitled to terminate the agreement under these circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.6. The Client is aware that dissatisfaction with aesthetical aspects of the Service will never result in attributable shortcomings on the part of Tradecast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.7. In any event parties will strive to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any knowledge they acquire as a result of the execution of the Service. All documents, samples, (business) models, items, films, content, concepts or data storage devices, whether in writing, digital and\/or electronic, will remain in possession of the party providing these for the execution of the Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 5. Applications \/ use by the Client<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.1. Only the Client receives the agreed upon exclusive right to make use of the Service provided by Tradecast and is not entitled to extend this right of use to one or several third parties, without the express written permission of Tradecast. A Client is required to request a transfer or exploitation of the Service by third parties no later than 14 days before the intended transfer or exploitation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.2 The Client does not have the right:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>to use and\/or apply the Service in violation with the law;<br>to perform, cause, promote, teach, extend and\/or publish unlawful or morally reprehensible activities and\/or views in any possible way, for whatever purpose;<br>to use the Service in any way, in order to possess or publish explicitly sexually-oriented material of whichever nature;<br>to use the Service in any way and\/or to use any other material in combination with the service, in such a way that one or several goods used by Tradecast are damaged, regardless of whether these goods are in possession of and\/or used by Tradecast or third parties.<br>5.3.

The terms and conditions of the Client apply to the processing, placement and management of this content, provided that these are in accordance with the General Terms and Conditions of Tradecast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.4. Tradecast is not responsible for damages suffered by the placement of Content, produced either by consumers or third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 6. Fines<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.1. In the event that a Client, to whatever degree, violates one or several provision(s) in the Agreement and\/or the General Terms and Conditions, the Client will pay Tradecast a fine amounting to \u20ac250 per day, without requiring a notice of default and\/or judicial intervention, regardless of whether the violation can be directly or indirectly attributed to the Client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.2. The fine does not repair any damages and, aside from the payable fine, Tradecast holds the Client accountable for damages resulting from the violations, of whichever nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.3. In the event of (a) violation(s) as referred to in this article, Tradecast B.V. is legally entitled to immediately terminate performing the Services, without Tradecast being held accountable in anyway by the Client and\/or one or more third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 7. Invoicing \/ payment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.1. Tradecast is legally entitled to charge the Client one or multiple advance payments before commencing performing the Service and\/or during the performance of the Service. In the event that parties are not able to agree upon the price, the method of payment and the obligation regarding these advance payment invoices, Tradecast is not obligated to commence performing the Service and\/or to continue performing the Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.2. As regards its invoices, Tradecast uses a payment deadline of 14 days.<br>In the event that this period is exceeded, the Client will be in default, upon which the Client immediately owes the legal commercial interest rate, in addition to the invoiced amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.3 All costs, regardless of whichever extrajudicial and\/or judicial nature, including attorney fees, bailiff fees and court registration fees, which Tradecast reasonably incurs in the process of collecting payment of the invoices, or within the context of whichever dispute with the Client and relating to the performance of the Service, will be charged to the Client. Any costs awarded against the Client by court order, will be deducted from the costs to which Tradecast is entitled of charging the Client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.4. In the event that the Client has to make regular payments to Tradecasts (for example as a result of a subscription), Tradecast is legally entitled to introduce regular price changes, if these price changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>are necessary due to inflationary reasons, and\/or;<br>are required due to other important (cost-increasing) circumstances on the part of Tradecast, and\/or;<br>do not exceed the 5% margin on the previous price maintained by Tradecast, and;<br>do not occur twice or more often within a period of three months, unless one increase relates to inflation and the other to important (cost-increasing) circumstances, in which event twice or more increases within three months are allowed.<br>7.5. In the event that Tradecast is required to apply a price increase exceeding 5%, the Client is entitled to terminate the Agreement due to that price increase, within 30 days after the actual price increase. After the 30-day period is exceeded, this entitlement ceases to exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.6 Tradecast at all times retains the right to charge the Client any fluctuations in exchange rates which relate to the Service or purchasing from third parties which relate to the Service, at the Client\u2019s next payment obligation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.7. In the event that the Client terminates the Agreement, as intended in art. 7.5 of the General Terms and Conditions, then the Client owes Tradecast the normal price that Tradecast would charge in the event of a complete and correct observation of the Agreement, in proportion to the period. If and insofar as Tradecast has been forced to engage the services of one or several third parties and Tradecast is not entitled to immediately terminate the agreement(s) involved in the event the Client terminates the Agreement, the Client also owes Tradecast the costs incurred by Tradecast by engaging the services of that third party\/those third parties, until the first moment that Tradecast is able to terminate the agreement(s) with that third party\/those third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.8. The Client is obligated to pay the invoices sent by Tradecast, without the Client being entitled to claim a settlement, suspension, deduction, discount or whichever other legal instrument which would obstruct complete payment of the invoices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.9. The prices named by Tradecast in the context of whichever consultation, negotiation and\/or Bid, are all excluding VAT and \u2013 unless expressly agreed otherwise \u2013 excluding costs incurred from third parties, material costs, transportation costs, travel expenses, accommodation and lost time costs, and\/or whichever other comparable costs, by Tradecast and\/or Tradecast\u2019s representatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.10. In the event that two or more Clients engage Tradecast for a single (partial) assignment, these two or more Clients are severally liable for the payment of the invoices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 8. Suspension<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.1. Tradecast is entitled to immediately cease performing the Service, in the event that the Client is in default regarding any payment obligation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 9. Termination of the agreement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.1. The Agreement between the Client and Tradecast ends when both parties have fulfilled all the conditions of the Agreement and\/or as referred to in these General Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.2. The Client is not entitled to prematurely terminate the Agreement, save for important reasons. In the event that the Client decides to terminate the agreement and Tradecast is forced to accept this termination (e.g. in the event of important reasons), the Client is obligated to pay any damages \u2013 either direct or indirect \u2013 suffered by Tradecast as a result of this termination. The Client is also obligated to pay a fine amounting to 50% of the fee owed to Tradecast as a result of the Agreement, excluding VAT. This fine does not repair any damages and is owed by the Client without requiring judicial intervention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.3. In the event that the Agreement between Tradecast and the Client is like a long-term agreement in nature and no specific agreements have been made regarding the termination\/continuation of the Agreement, the Client can only terminate the Agreement by the end of the month, upon four months\u2019 notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.4. The notice period as referred to in article 9.3 of the General Terms and Conditions is longer if and insofar as Tradecast has had to engage the services of one or more third parties in order to perform the Service, the agreement with which cannot be terminated within the mentioned notice period of four months. In that case a notice period applies which is equal to the notice period to which Tradecast is bound in that\/those agreement(s) with that\/those third party\/third parties, in any event with a minimum of four months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Article 10. Liability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.1.

If and insofar as Tradecast has made periodic arrangements with the Client, the aforementioned liability will be limited to an amount which equals twice the value of the periodic invoice which Tradecast is entitled to send to the Client in that case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.4. Tradecast is not liable for the placement of and reference to Content of third parties placed by the Client. The Content at all times remains in possession of the legal owner and will not become possession of the Client or Tradecast by placement of the reference, provided that the Client is the owner of the Content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.5.
