<p><strong>Article 1. Definitions</strong></p>



<p>In these general terms and conditions, the following definitions will apply:</p>



<p>Tradecast: the BV (Dutch limited company) Tradecast B.V., regardless of whether trade name Tradecast B.V. or another trade name is used.<br>Client: one or several third parties with which Tradecast enters into/has entered into one or several (partial) agreements and on behalf of whom Tradecast performs services.<br>General Terms and Conditions: the current General Terms and Conditions which apply to all legal actions taken by Tradecast or whichever action taken by Tradecast results in a commitment with (a) third party/parties.<br>Service: every work activity consisting of one or several aspects, regardless of whichever (im)material nature, which Tradecast performs on behalf of (a) Client(s) and/or every delivery of one or more goods/services.<br>Bid: Tradecast’s offering to the Client in which offering in any case (summarily) the required Services and the price are provided.<br>Agreement: The Agreement between Tradecast and the client, from which the Service Tradecast will perform arises.<br>Content: audio-visual and textual material which is placed and/or referred to in the context of the Service by either Tradecast, third parties, consumers or the Client.</p>



<p><strong>Article 2. General/applicability terms and conditions</strong></p>



<p>2.1. The General Terms and Conditions apply to all legal actions taken by Tradecast and/or whichever action taken by Tradecast results in a commitment with (a) third party/parties.</p>



<p>2.2. General Terms and Conditions of a Client are expressly rejected.</p>



<p>2.3. Tradecast does not accept any general (written) references to general terms and conditions of a Client.</p>



<p>2.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions are declared null or void, the remaining provisions in these General Terms and Conditions will remain in force regardless.</p>



<p>2.5. Tradecast retains the right to change the General Terms and Conditions at any time. Changes also apply to agreements already in force.</p>



<p>2.6. The Client is notified of changes in the General Terms and Conditions and the effective date of the changed General Terms and Conditions by email. The Client can announce not to agree with the changed General Terms and Conditions and retains the right to terminate the Agreement as of the effective date of the changed General Terms and Conditions.</p>



<p><strong>Article 3. Realisation of the agreement</strong></p>



<p>3.1. Bids are made in writing (and/or by email) and are completely non-binding.</p>



<p>3.2. An agreement is entered into when Tradecast receives the Bid, signed by the Client and returned by mail, fax or email.</p>



<p>3.3. In the absence of a signed bid, an Agreement between the Client and Tradecast is entered into when Tradecast commences to perform the Service on behalf of the Client.</p>



<p>3.4. In the event that, for whichever reason in the absence of a Bid signed by the Client, Tradecast commences to perform the Service, the Client is expected to have agreed to the Bid.</p>



<p>3.5. All bids made by Tradecast are non-binding. Tradecast retains the right to revoke already made bids. The bid is at all times based on the information provided by the client</p>

<p><strong>Article 4. Performance of the agreement</strong></p>



<p>4.1. Tradecast performs the work activities regarding the Service carefully and taking into consideration the standards which apply to Tradecast’s discipline.</p>



<p>4.2. If and insofar that the Client allows any changes to the Service, after parties have agreed on the (method of) execution of the Agreement, such changes shall be considered additional work. In that event, Tradecast is legally entitled to charge the customary price for such additional work, in addition to the price agreed upon for the Service. In the event that changes result in less work, the agreed upon price will remain in force.</p>



<p>4.3. For the execution of the service, Tradecast is (partially) dependent on the data and information provided by the Client. Tradecast cannot perform the Service in the event that the provision of data and information does not and/or not timely take place. Tradecast does not commit any breach towards the Client in the event that data and/or information which is provided by the Client too late and/or incorrectly results in shortcomings in the performance of the Service. In the event that, after the Client has been explicitly notified by Tradecast that it has committed a shortcoming, whereby a reasonable period for delivery and/or notification is provided, the Client fails to fulfil his/her obligation to provide the required information, Tradecast is legally entitled to terminate the agreement and the Client will be obligated to pay the damages suffered by Tradecast as a result.</p>



<p>4.4. Tradecast is entitled to engage the services of (a) third party/parties in order to perform the Service, without requiring the permission of the Client.</p>



<p>4.5. In the event that the execution of a Service needs to be changed, due to a circumstance for which Tradecast cannot be held accountable, then such a change will occur after due consultation between the Client and Tradecast. The Client is not entitled to terminate the agreement under these circumstances.</p>



<p>4.6. The Client is aware that dissatisfaction with aesthetical aspects of the Service will never result in attributable shortcomings on the part of Tradecast.</p>



<p>4.7. In any event parties will strive to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any knowledge they acquire as a result of the execution of the Service. All documents, samples, (business) models, items, films, content, concepts or data storage devices, whether in writing, digital and/or electronic, will remain in possession of the party providing these for the execution of the Service.</p>



<p><strong>Article 5. Applications / use by the Client</strong></p>



<p>5.1. Only the Client receives the agreed upon exclusive right to make use of the Service provided by Tradecast and is not entitled to extend this right of use to one or several third parties, without the express written permission of Tradecast. A Client is required to request a transfer or exploitation of the Service by third parties no later than 14 days before the intended transfer or exploitation.</p>



<p>5.2 The Client does not have the right:</p>
